What are tokenomics?

In web3, Tokenomics (short for Token Economics) is the study of how value is distributed, shared, and moved among different users engaged with a decentralized protocol. To understand Tokenomics, itâ€™s important to understand why various blockchain projects have native cryptocurrencies. All cryptocurrencies are created to enable some decentralized application or protocol, which is a service that no single individual or entity operates. Rather than relying on a centralized organization, such as a corporation, to oversee day-to-day operations, a decentralized application or protocol is governed by a community of individuals with aligned interests.

Tokenomics addresses a few key questions related to any blockchain project. For example: 

    What drives demand for the token? 

    What is the utility of the token and how is the token used in the protocol?

    How does the token capture value created by the protocol?

    How are tokens distributed to various stakeholders aligned to the project?

The Tokenomics of any protocol describe how value flows throughout the protocol and assigns a set of rules to govern these value flows. Tokenomics are significant in the web3 ecosystem and can have substantial influence on the success (or lack thereof) of protocols that choose to issue a native token.
